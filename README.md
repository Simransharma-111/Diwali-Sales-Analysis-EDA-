# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-EDA-
I developed a  project that explores sales trends and customer behavior during the Diwali season. It focuses on cleaning the data, analyzing it, and visualizing patterns to uncover useful insights. The project uses Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to help understand sales trends and identify key customer groups.
